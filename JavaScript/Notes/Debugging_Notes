Introduction to Debugging
Debugging is the process of reviewing your code to find out why it behaves the way it does.There are 3 common
errors one will encounter when debugging their code, these consist of:
                -Runtime errors(having an infinite loop)
                -Syntax error(misspelling of keywords or variable names)
                -Semantic error(these are logical errors in your code)
This section will focus on the tools we can use to debug our code as well as strategies of going about debugging.


Use the JavaScript Console to Check the Value of a Variable
We can use the chrome developer tools or firefox's web console to help us debug our code. It is important to keep
in mind that debugging is a frustrating process, one that takes time and can only be improved upon through
experience and time, thankfully we can use the "console.log()" statement to help ease the debugging process.
console.log allows us to output our variable values to the console to have a look at whats stored inside them.
Placing the console.log() statement strategically throughout your code can help you analyze the flow of your code
as well as anticipate or determine were the variable values change or display irregular behaviour.


Use typeof to Check the Type of a Variable
typeof can help us in determining the data type of the variable or data structure being used. for instance
say we have a function that is meant to add two variables which are of type number. Using typeof within the
function can help us make certain that the function only takes two variables of type number and performs
arithmetic operation on those numbers.
