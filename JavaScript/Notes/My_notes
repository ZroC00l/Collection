Javascript is a high level programming language that makes up core of what the web is and how it
functions.To understand the language you must know its syntax from its data types, variables to
more complex components as in functions and objects.

Javascript Variables

To declare a variable in JavaScript you need to make use of the 'var' keyword followed by the
name of the variable. A variable is the name we use to hold the data we will refer to later in
our code when its time to use the data.

    var my_var1;

The above example is a typical illustration of how to declare a variable, take note that varibales
in JavaScript can only contain numbers,letters and special characters like underscores and $.
A variable name under no circumstances should ever begin with a number or a special character other
than an underscore.

JavaScript Data types

JavaScript supports 8 different data types:
    -boolean
    -null
    -string
    -bigint
    -undefined
    -symbol
    -number
    -object

Storing Values with the Assignment Operator

We use the assignment operator(=) to store data into our variable.Take note the data to the right
of the assignment operator is always resolved first before storing the data in the variable that is
to the left of the assignment operator.Below is an example of assigning values to a variable.

    var x;
    var y=8;

    x=2
    y=x;
Although y has its own value of 8, it is later overridden to the same value as x which is 2.
In JavaScript a variable that is declared but has no value/data assigned to it is regarded as an
undefined variable.If you perform an arithmetic operation on an undefined variable the answer will be
"NaN" which means Not a Number. If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable then the result
will be a literal string of "undefined".

Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables

It is important to note that the way in which you write out your variable names is important.JavaScript
is case sensitive which means you can have distinct variables but have them use the same words however the casing
used makes them distinct:

    var mY_VAR1;
    var MY_vAr1;
    var my_VaR1;

The above variables all use the word "var1" but javascript interprets each differently because of casing used.
So  we have 3 distinct variables each using a unique casing to differentiate it.To avoid this problem it is
considered best JavaScript practice to use camelcase when defining you variable names:

camelCase is a type of casing whereby we have a multiple word variable and the first word of the variable name
is in lowercase and the subsequent word after that have each of their first letter capitalized and the rest of their
letters in smallcase e.g:

    var postalAddress;
    var blockChainCommand;
    var pointOfOrigin;

Finding a Remainder in JavaScript
The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.
    5 % 2 = 1 because
    Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
    2 * 2 = 4
    5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
Usage
In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by
checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.
The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "modulus" operator.
It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition,subtraction,division and multiplication

In programming, it is common to use assignments to modify the contents of a variable.
Remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, so we can say:

    myVar = myVar + 5;

to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a
mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

One such operator is the += operator.as well as *=, /= , -=.

Escaping Literal Quotes in Strings

When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?
In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.

    var sampleStr = "Alan said, \"Peter is learning JavaScript\".";

string values in JavaScript may be written with single or double quotes, as long as you start and end with the same type of quote
unlike some other programming languages, single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.
    doubleQuoteStr = "This is a string";
    singleQuoteStr = 'This is also a string';

The reason why you might want to use one type of quote over the other is if you want to use both in a string. This might happen if you want to save a conversation in a string and have the conversation in quotes.
Another use for it would be saving an <a> tag with various attributes in quotes, all within a string e.g.

    var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';

However, this becomes a problem if you need to use the outermost quotes within it. Remember, a string has the same kind of quote at the beginning and end.
But if you have that same quote somewhere in the middle, the string will stop early and throw an error.

    goodStr = 'Jake asks Finn, "Hey, let\'s go on an adventure?"';
    badStr = 'Finn responds, "Let's go!"'; // Throws an error

Escape Sequences in Strings

Escape sequence in strings help us to represent characters we may not want to write out within a string literal
by using escape sequences to represent those character.The following are examples of common escape sequences used
in JavaScript:
    Code	Output
    \'	single quote
    \"	double quote
    \\	backslash
    \n	newline
    \r	carriage return
    \t	tab
    \b	word boundary
    \f	form feed
To show how the escape sequences work take for example the string below:

    var myString= "FirstSecondLineThirdLine";
To make the string above appear similar to the string output below:

    FirstLine
        SecondLine
    ThirdLine
We need to use escape sequence characters, the following is an illustration of how we can achieve this:

    var myString= "FirstLine \n \t SecondLine \n ThirdLine";

Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator

In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator.
You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

We can also use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end of an existing string variable.
This can be very helpful to break a long string over several lines.

    var ourStr = "I come first. ";
    ourStr += "I come second.";

Appending Variables to Strings

Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.
Example:

    var anAdjective = "awesome!";
    var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
    ourStr += anAdjective;

Find the Length of a String

You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

        "Alan Peter".length; // 10

For example, if we created a variable var firstName = "Charles", we could find out how long the string "Charles" is by using the firstName.length property

Use Bracket Notation to Find the First Character in a String

Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do.
They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.
Example:

        var firstName = "Charles";
        var firstLetter = firstName[0]; // firstLetter is "C"

Understand String Immutability

In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.
For example, the following code:

        var myStr = "Bob";
        myStr[0] = "J";

cannot change the value of myStr to "Job", because the contents of myStr cannot be altered.
Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed.
The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:

        var myStr = "Bob";
        myStr = "Job";
In short you cannot change a Javascript string literal by altering a portion of it , you will need to re-assign
another string literal into the variable , so changing the whole string literal is the only way to alter it.

Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.
Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String

In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.

For example, if var firstName = "Charles", you can get the value of the last letter of the string
by using firstName[firstName.length - 1].
Example:

        var firstName = "Charles";
        var lastLetter = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth-to-Last Character in a String

You can use the same principle we just used to retrieve the last character in a string to retrieve the Nth-to-last character.
For example, you can get the value of the third-to-last letter
of the var firstName = "Charles" string by using firstName[firstName.length - 3]

Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays

With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.
You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, and put a comma between each entry, like this:

    var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"].

Nest one Array within Another Array

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

        [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]] //This is called a multidimensional Array

Access Array Data with Indexes

We can access the data inside arrays using indexes.

Array indexes are written in the same bracket notation that strings use, except that instead of specifying a character, they are specifying an entry in the array.
Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.
Example:
    var array = [50,60,70];
    array[0]; // equals 50
    var data = array[1];  // equals 60

Modify Array Data With Indexes

Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely.
Example:
    var ourArray = [50,40,30];
    ourArray[0] = 15; // equals [15,40,30]

Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array,
and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.
Example:
    var arr = [
      [1,2,3],
      [4,5,6],
      [7,8,9],
      [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
    ];
    arr[3]; // equals [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
    arr[3][0]; // equals [10,11,12]
    arr[3][0][1]; // equals 11

Manipulate Arrays With push()
An easy way to append data to the end of an array is via the push() function.
.push() takes one or more parameters and "pushes" them onto the end of the array.
Examples:
        var arr1 = [1,2,3];
        arr1.push(4);
        // arr1 is now [1,2,3,4]

        var arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
        arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);
        // arr2 now equals ["Stimpson", "J", "cat", ["happy", "joy"]]

Manipulate Arrays With pop()
Another way to change the data in an array is with the .pop() function.
.pop() is used to "pop" a value off of the end of an array. We can store this "popped off" value by assigning it to a variable. In other words, .pop() removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
Any type of entry can be "popped" off of an array - numbers, strings, even nested arrays.

        var threeArr = [1, 4, 6];
        var oneDown = threeArr.pop();
        console.log(oneDown); // Returns 6
        console.log(threeArr); // Returns [1, 4]

Manipulate Arrays With shift()
pop() always removes the last element of an array. What if you want to remove the first?
That's where .shift() comes in. It works just like .pop(), except it removes the first element instead of the last.
Example:

    var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", ["cat"]];
    var removedFromOurArray = ourArray.shift();

Manipulate Arrays With unshift()
Not only can you shift elements off of the beginning of an array, you can also unshift elements to the beginning of an array i.e. add elements in front of the array.
.unshift() works exactly like .push(), but instead of adding the element at the end of the array, unshift() adds the element at the beginning of the array.
Example:
    var ourArray = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
    ourArray.shift(); // ourArray now equals ["J", "cat"]
    ourArray.unshift("Happy");
    // ourArray now equals ["Happy", "J", "cat"]

Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions
In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.
Here's an example of a function:

    function functionName() {
      console.log("Hello World");
    }
You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses,
like this: functionName(); Each time the function is called it will print out the message "Hello World" on the dev console.
All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

Passing Values to Functions with Arguments
Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a
function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters.
The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.
Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:

        function testFun(param1, param2) {
          console.log(param1, param2);
        }
Then we can call testFun: testFun("Hello", "World"); We have passed two arguments, "Hello" and "World".
Inside the function, param1 will equal "Hello" and param2 will equal "World".
Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.

Global Scope and Functions
In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables.
Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope.
This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.
Variables which are used without the var keyword are automatically created in the global scope.
This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again.
You should always declare your variables with var.

Local Scope and Functions
Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters have local scope.
That means, they are only visible within that function.
Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc:
    function myTest() {
      var loc = "foo";
      console.log(loc);
    }
    myTest(); // logs "foo"
    console.log(loc); // loc is not defined

Global vs. Local Scope in Functions
It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name.
When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.
In this example:
        var someVar = "Hat";
        function myFun() {
          var someVar = "Head";
          return someVar;
        }
The function myFun will return "Head" because the local version of the variable is present.

Return a Value from a Function with Return
We can pass values into a function with arguments.
You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.
Example:
        function plusThree(num) {
          return num + 3;
        }
        var answer = plusThree(5); // 8
plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.

Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function
A function can include the return statement but it does not have to.
In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.
Example:
        var sum = 0;
        function addSum(num) {
          sum = sum + num;
        }
        addSum(3);
addSum is a function without a return statement.
The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.

Assignment with a Returned Value
If you'll recall from our discussion of Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned.
This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.
Assume we have pre-defined a function sum which adds two numbers together, then:

        ourSum = sum(5, 12);

will call sum function, which returns a value of 17 and assigns it to ourSum variable.

Stand in Line
In Computer Science a queue is an abstract Data Structure where items are kept in order.
New items can be added at the back of the queue and old items are taken off from the front of the queue.

Understanding Boolean Values
Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false.
They are basically little on-off switches, where true is "on" and false is "off."
These two states are mutually exclusive.

Use Conditional Logic with If Statements
If statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in
the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean
conditions and they may only be true or false.

When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces.
When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.
Pseudocode:

    if (condition is true) {
      statement is executed
    }
Comparison with the Equality Operator
There are many comparison operators in JavaScript.
All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.
The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns
true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=),
which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.
    function equalityTest(myVal) {
      if (myVal == 10) {
         return "Equal";
      }
      return "Not Equal";
    }
If myVal is equal to 10, the equality operator returns true, so the code in the curly braces will execute,
and the function will return "Equal". Otherwise, the function will return "Not Equal".
In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings),
 it must convert one type to another. This is known as "Type Coercion".
Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:
    1   ==  1   // true
    1   ==  2   // false
    1   == '1'  // true
    "3" ==  3   // true

Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==).
However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type,
the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.
If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal,
and the strict equality operator will return false.
Examples:

    3 ===  3   // true
    3 === '3'  // false

Practice comparing different values
In the last two challenges, we learned about the equality operator (==) and the strict equality operator (===).
Let's do a quick review and practice using these operators some more.
If the values being compared are not of the same type, the equality operator will perform a type conversion
and then evaluate the values. However, the strict equality operator will compare both the data type and value as-is, without converting one type to the other.
Examples:

    3 == '3'  // returns true because JavaScript performs type conversion from string to number
    3 === '3' // returns false because the types are different and type conversion is not performed
In JavaScript, you can determine the type of a variable or a value with the typeof operator, as follows:

    typeof 3   // returns 'number'
    typeof '3' // returns 'string'

Comparison with the Inequality Operator
The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator.
It means "Not Equal" and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa.
Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.
Examples:

    1 !=  2     // true
    1 != "1"    // false
    1 != '1'    // false
    1 != true   // false
    0 != false  // false

Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator
The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator.
It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa.
Strict inequality will not convert data types.
Examples:

    3 !==  3   // false
    3 !== '3'  // true
    4 !==  3   // true
Comparison with the Greater Than Operator
The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater
than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
Like the equality operator, greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.
Examples:

    5   >  3   // true
    7   > '3'  // true
    2   >  3   // false
    '1' >  9   // false

Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator
The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers.
If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true.
Otherwise, it returns false.
Like the equality operator, greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.
Examples:

    6   >=  6   // true
    7   >= '3'  // true
    2   >=  3   // false
    '7' >=  9   // false
Comparison with the Less Than Operator
The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the
number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
Like the equality operator, less than operator converts data types while comparing.
Examples:

    2   < 5  // true
    '3' < 7  // true
    5   < 5  // false
    3   < 2  // false
    '8' < 4  // false
Comparison with the Less Than Or Equal To Operator
The less than or equal to operator (<=) compares the values of two numbers.
If the number to the left is less than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true.
If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. Like the equality operator, less than or equal to converts data types.
Examples:

    4   <= 5  // true
    '7' <= 7  // true
    5   <= 5  // true
    3   <= 2  // false
    '8' <= 4  // false

Comparisons with the Logical And Operator
Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time.
The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.
The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if:
    if (num > 5) {
      if (num < 10) {
        return "Yes";
      }
    }
    return "No";
will only return "Yes" if num is greater than 5 and less than 10. The same logic can be written as:
    if(num>5 && num<10){
        return "Yes";
    }
    return "No";
Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator
The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.
The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (||). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.
The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints:
    if (num > 10) {
      return "No";
    }
    if (num < 5) {
      return "No";
    }
    return "Yes";
will return "Yes" only if num is between 5 and 10 (5 and 10 included). The same logic can be written as:

    if (num > 10 || num < 5) {
      return "No";
    }
    return "Yes";

Introducing Else Statements
When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is executed.
What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen.
With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.
    if (num > 10) {
      return "Bigger than 10";
    } else {
      return "10 or Less";
    }
Introducing Else If Statements
If you have multiple conditions that need to be addressed, you can chain if statements together
with else if statements.
    if (num > 15) {
      return "Bigger than 15";
    } else if (num < 5) {
      return "Smaller than 5";
    } else {
      return "Between 5 and 15";
    }
Logical Order in If Else Statements
Order is important in if, else if statements.
The function is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of what statement comes first.
Take these two functions as an example.
Here's the first:

    function foo(x) {
      if (x < 1) {
        return "Less than one";
      } else if (x < 2) {
        return "Less than two";
      } else {
        return "Greater than or equal to two";
      }
    }
And the second just switches the order of the statements:
    function bar(x) {
      if (x < 2) {
        return "Less than two";
      } else if (x < 1) {
        return "Less than one";
      } else {
        return "Greater than or equal to two";
      }
    }
While these two functions look nearly identical if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.

    foo(0) // "Less than one"
    bar(0) // "Less than two"

Chaining If Else Statements
if/else statements can be chained together for complex logic.
Here is pseudocode of multiple chained if / else if statements:

    if (condition1) {
      statement1
    } else if (condition2) {
      statement2
    } else if (condition3) {
      statement3
    . . .
    } else {
      statementN
    }
Selecting from Many Options with Switch Statements
If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement.
A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values.
Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.
Here is an example of a switch statement:

    switch(lowercaseLetter) {
      case "a":
        console.log("A");
        break;
      case "b":
        console.log("B");
        break;
    }
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements.
If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements
In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements.
Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found.
Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.
A default statement should be the last case.
    switch (num) {
      case value1:
        statement1;
        break;
      case value2:
        statement2;
        break;
    ...
      default:
        defaultStatement;
        break;
    }

Multiple Identical Options in Switch Statements
If the break statement is omitted from a switch statement's case, the following case statement(s) are executed until a break is encountered.
If you have multiple inputs with the same output, you can represent them in a switch statement like this:
    switch(val) {
      case 1:
      case 2:
      case 3:
        result = "1, 2, or 3";
        break;
      case 4:
        result = "4 alone";
    }
Replacing If Else Chains with Switch
If you have many options to choose from, a switch statement can be easier to write than many
chained if/else if statements. The following:
    if (val === 1) {
      answer = "a";
    } else if (val === 2) {
      answer = "b";
    } else {
      answer = "c";
    }
    can be replaced with:

    switch(val) {
      case 1:
        answer = "a";
        break;
      case 2:
        answer = "b";
        break;
      default:
        answer = "c";
    }

Returning Boolean Values from Functions
You may recall from Comparison with the Equality Operator that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.
Sometimes people use an if/else statement to do a comparison, like this:

     function isEqual(a,b) {
       if (a === b) {
         return true;
       } else {
         return false;
       }
     }
But there's a better way to do this. Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:

     function isEqual(a,b) {
       return a === b;


     }
Return Early Pattern for Functions
When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.
Example

    function myFun() {
      console.log("Hello");
      return "World";
      console.log("byebye")
    }
    myFun();
The above  outputs "Hello" to the console, returns "World", but "byebye" is never output, because the function exits at the return statement.
Hint:
Remember that undefined is a keyword, not a string.So when they say a function should return undefined it should
return the keyword undefined and not the string "undefined".


Build JavaScript Objects

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.
Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.
Here's a sample cat object:

    var cat = {
      "name": "Whiskers",
      "legs": 4,
      "tails": 1,
      "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
    };
In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as - "name", "legs", and "tails".
However, you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string
properties, as follows:
    var anotherObject = {
      make: "Ford",
      5: "five",
      "model": "focus"
    };
However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically
typecast them as strings.

Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.
Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.
Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:

    var myObj = {
      prop1: "val1",
      prop2: "val2"
    };
    var prop1val = myObj.prop1; // val1
    var prop2val = myObj.prop2; // val2
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.
However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.
Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:

    var myObj = {
      "Space Name": "Kirk",
      "More Space": "Spock",
      "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
    };
    myObj["Space Name"]; // Kirk
    myObj['More Space']; // Spock
    myObj["NoSpace"];    // USS Enterprise
    Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

Accessing Object Properties with Variables
Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable.
This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.
Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

    var dogs = {
      Fido: "Mutt",  Hunter: "Doberman",  Snoopie: "Beagle"
    };
    var myDog = "Hunter";
    var myBreed = dogs[myDog];
    console.log(myBreed); // "Doberman"
Another way you can use this concept is when the property's name is collected dynamically during the program execution, as follows:
    var someObj = {
      propName: "John"
    };
    function propPrefix(str) {
      var s = "prop";
      return s + str;
    }
    var someProp = propPrefix("Name"); // someProp now holds the value 'propName'
    console.log(someObj[someProp]); // "John"

Updating Object Properties
After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.
For example, let's look at ourDog:

        var ourDog = {
          "name": "Camper",
          "legs": 4,
          "tails": 1,
          "friends": ["everything!"]
        };
Since he's a particularly happy dog, let's change his name to "Happy Camper".
Here's how we update his object's name property:

    ourDog.name = "Happy Camper";
                or
    ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper";

Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting "Camper", we'll get his new name, "Happy Camper".

Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object
You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.
Here's how we would add a "bark" property to ourDog:

        ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
                   or
        ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";

Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, "bow-wow".
Example:

        var ourDog = {
          "name": "Camper",
          "legs": 4,
          "tails": 1,
          "friends": ["everything!"]
        };

        ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";

Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object
We can also delete properties from objects like this:

        delete ourDog.bark;
Example:

        var ourDog = {
          "name": "Camper",
          "legs": 4,
          "tails": 1,
          "friends": ["everything!"],
          "bark": "bow-wow"
        };

        delete ourDog.bark;

Using Objects for Lookups
Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary.
If you have tabular data, you can use an object to "lookup" values rather than a switch statement or
an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.

Here is an example of a simple reverse alphabet lookup:

    var alpha = {
      1:"Z",
      2:"Y",
      3:"X",
      4:"W",
      ...
      24:"C",
      25:"B",
      26:"A"
    };
    alpha[2]; // "Y"
    alpha[24]; // "C"

    var value = 2;
    alpha[value]; // "Y"

Testing Objects for Properties
Sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object exists or not. We can use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of objects to determine if that object has the given property name. .hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or not.
Example:

    var myObj = {
      top: "hat",
      bottom: "pants"
    };
    myObj.hasOwnProperty("top");    // true
    myObj.hasOwnProperty("middle"); // false

Manipulating Complex Objects
Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data.
They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.
Here's an example of a complex data structure:

    var ourMusic = [
      {
        "artist": "Daft Punk",
        "title": "Homework",
        "release_year": 1997,
        "formats": [
          "CD",
          "Cassette",
          "LP"
        ],
        "gold": true
      }
    ];
This is an array which contains one object inside.
The object has various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested "formats" array.
If you want to add more album records, you can do this by adding records to the top level array.
Objects hold data in a property, which has a key-value format.
In the example above,
"artist": "Daft Punk" is a property that has a key of "artist" and a value of "Daft Punk".
JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a related data interchange format used to store data.

    {
      "artist": "Daft Punk",
      "title": "Homework",
      "release_year": 1997,
      "formats": [
        "CD",
        "Cassette",
        "LP"
      ],
      "gold": true
    }

Accessing Nested Objects
The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.
Here is a nested object:

        var ourStorage = {
          "desk": {
            "drawer": "stapler"
          },
          "cabinet": {
            "top drawer": {
              "folder1": "a file",
              "folder2": "secrets"
            },
            "bottom drawer": "soda"
          }
        };
        ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2;  // "secrets"
        ourStorage.desk.drawer; // "stapler"

Accessing Nested Arrays
As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays.
Similar to accessing nested objects, Array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.
Here is an example of how to access a nested array:

        var ourPets = [
          {
            animalType: "cat",
            names: [
              "Meowzer",
              "Fluffy",
              "Kit-Cat"
            ]
          },
          {
            animalType: "dog",
            names: [
              "Spot",
              "Bowser",
              "Frankie"
            ]
          }
        ];
        ourPets[0].names[1]; // "Fluffy"
        ourPets[1].names[0]; // "Spot"
