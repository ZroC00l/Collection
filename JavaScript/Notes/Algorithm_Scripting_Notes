Introduction to Basic Algorithm Scripting
This section will focus on using learning algorithms to solve problems and code them. To write an algorithm
one has to have a solid understanding of the problem at hand. An algorithm simply put is a sequence of steps
you take in solving a problem.The easiest way to solve a problem in programming is breaking the problem down
in to small manageable pieces that can be solved easily.

Converting Celsius to Fahrenheit
Write a function that takes a single argument.That argument will be the temperature in celsius, your function
should take in that argument in celsius and convert it to fahrenheit and return the results.

    alogrithm to convert celsius to fahrenheit: (temperature_in_celsius*(9/5))+32

Reverse a string
Write a method that takes a string as an argument and returns that string in reverse order.Dont use an array
or any additional methods to reverse the string:

    algorithm:
                tempStr=""; //to hold the reverse string
                for(i is equal to end of array string;i is greater than or equal to 0; decrement i)
                    tempStr += string[for each index];

                 string=tempStr;


Finding largest Element in SubArrays
Write a method which takes in as parameter an array of subarrays , and find the largest element in each
subarray. The method should return an array consisting of the largest element from each subarray

    algorithm:
            -declare an empty array to hold our result
            -create first for loop with i=0 and the condition i<arr.length
            -inside the first loop create a local var to hold the largest element
            (this element will be the first value of the first subArray )
            -So the step will be let max=arr[i][0]
            -then nest another for loop with j=1 and the condition j<arr[i].length
            (remember its a 2d array so it will require 2 loops j=1 so that its possible to iterate
            through the inner loop without going out of bounds)
            -inside the inner loop create an if statement :

                if( array[row_index][column_index]>max)
                    -then set max to the current largest value
            -in the outer for loop then store the max into the results array
            -then return the results array outside of the outer loop for the result.


Check Substring
Write a method which takes in two parameters one should be a string and the other should be the substring
the method should return true if the string ends with the substring argument or false if not.
The method should not use the built in function endsWith()

Repeat String
Write a method that takes in two parameters one a string the other a number, the method should then the string
repeatedly depending the number argument , if the argument is 0 or negative return an empty string
