Introduction to Basic Algorithm Scripting
This section will focus on using learning algorithms to solve problems and code them. To write an algorithm
one has to have a solid understanding of the problem at hand. An algorithm simply put is a sequence of steps
you take in solving a problem.The easiest way to solve a problem in programming is breaking the problem down
in to small manageable pieces that can be solved easily.

Converting Celsius to Fahrenheit
Write a function that takes a single argument.That argument will be the temperature in celsius, your function
should take in that argument in celsius and convert it to fahrenheit and return the results.

    alogrithm to convert celsius to fahrenheit: (temperature_in_celsius*(9/5))+32

Reverse a string
Write a method that takes a string as an argument and returns that string in reverse order.Dont use an array
or any additional methods to reverse the string:

    algorithm:
                tempStr=""; //to hold the reverse string
                for(i is equal to end of array string;i is greater than or equal to 0; decrement i)
                    tempStr += string[for each index];

                 string=tempStr;
