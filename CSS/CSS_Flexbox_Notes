INTRODUCTION TO CSS FLEXBOX
A Website typically consists of two components:
	1.Visual elements= this refers to the images, color and font elements
	2.positioning elements= this are the elements used in placing the visual elements

Flexbox is a new CSS feature only supported among the modern popular browsers. Flexbox is a layout container of some sort used for Dynamic User Interfaces.Flexbox arrranges the UI elements in such a way that the layout is represented well across the various devices and browsers used to access the content.

WORKING WITH THE DISPLAY PROPERTY

We have seen the display property used before when we did the CSS basics , it consisted of the inline property value used to manipulate the inline style of nav's list items. We go deeper into the display property by having a look at one of its property values called flex.
Adding a "display:flex" CSS property to an element allows you to have access to other flex properties to be able to build a responsive page.

Adding the CSS display:flex property turns the element on which its applied on to a flex container. This makes it possible to align children of the element in rows or columns using the "flex-direction" CSS property. The flex-direction property uses 4 property values:
	
	1.row= this is the default value of the property
	2.column
	3.row-reverse
	4.column reverse

using the CSS flex property for instance we would have a parent div container encapsulating 2 or more child div elements then for the styling property the parent container will be the only property that contains the "dispaly:flex and flex-direction" CSS properties.Its child elements will inherit whatever flex-direction property value is used if it row, then the child elements will be arranged in a row and if its a column,row-reverse or column-reverse then they will be arranged accordingly.

To understand the flex properties properly we look at a tweet embed that uses just html , you task will be to create a tweet embed that uses CSS display flex properties to emulate a real tweet embed.
