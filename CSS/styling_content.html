	<ul>
		<li>Current Champion: Stipe Miocic</li>
		<li>Won Title:17 August 2019</li>
		<li>Event:UFC 241</li>
		<li>Won By: TKO</li>
		<li>Opponent won against: Daniel DC Cormier</li>
		<li>Title Defense:0</li>

		The Heavyweight division has been promising in the past events, with UFC 241 seeing Stipe reclaim his heavyweight title
		back in a brawl against a future hall of famer and olympic medalist Daniel Cormier. The rematch to decide the trilogy has been
		set for UFC 252, this will be the deciding match on who really is the heavyweight king. This may not come as a surprise but whoever
		the winner of the trilogy is, they will have to fight none other Francis Nnganou, who recently has been rampaging throughout the division.
		Should Stipe win the trilogy he will have to face Francis in their second bout,although Stipe came out victorious in the first bout, the second one
		should be more interesting since Francis has gained more experience,speed and knockout power, this sure will be one to be remembered for years.
