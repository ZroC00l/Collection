		<h2>Web development</h2>
		<p class="spacing">
			Web development simply put is the process of developing websites for the internet of world wide web as its formally known.
			Looking into the growth of web development over the years saying its for building websites is mildly putting it as the field of web development
			has grown immensely in the last 10 years or so, from building simple static pages to advanced web-based systems that are interactive and can
			do a whole more functionalities than basic static web pages.

			Behind that force to reckon with are the developers , one can call them the magicians of the internet since they are equipped with the
			skills and knowledge of bringing ideas to life by creating. To be a developer is not as easy as it sounds, it takes time to develop the
			understanding of the web and its technologies and how everything fits together. You don't simply wake and say you are a developer you have to
			put in the time and effort and definitely work to be able to create and solve problems by building products.

			Almost every business today relies on having an online presence to increase their target market or sell their product.Thats where web development
			comes into play. A great business without online presence is a business set up to fail, we live in a modern digital world with smartphones, tablest, ipads and
			all sorts of gadgets that people use to stay connected. So for a business to thrive and attract more people it needs a driving engine behind it and that is
			online presence, a website, a web app or simply an app can suffice to increase a business's online  target market.

		<h2>Web Development Technologies</h2>
		<p class="spacing">
			To be considered a developer one has to have a firm understanding of the web technologies used. There are a variety
			of these technologies each offering its own unique capabilities or functionalities. The follwing is a list of web development frameworks
			a developer needs to be familiar with to be effective as a web developer:
			<ul>
				<li>React Native</li>
				<li>Angular</li>
				<li>VanillaJS</li>
				<li>MeteorJS</li>
				<li>BackboneJS</li>
				<li>NodeJS</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p	class="spacing">
			Knowing two of the named above frameworks puts you on a different level as a developer as it allows the developer to be
			well versed and know which framework to use in various cases when building a web-based system, different frameworks provide unique different
			functions, thus knowing more than one framework is an added advantage to a developer's resume. Now you dont jump to a framework if you
			are a novice developer , you need to have a well established background on javascript which is the language that the above frameworks use.
			Think of Javascript as batman and the framework used as his utility belt , a framework gives you more power however you need to be able to understand
			that power and work with it thus knowledge of javascript is imperative.
