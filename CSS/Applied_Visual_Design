INTRODUCTION TO APPLIED VISUAL DESIGN 
HTML is responsible for the structure and semantics of a page's content while CSS is in charge of the layout and appearance
This section covers the basic tools developers use to create their own visual design

Text is a huge part of a page's content, thus CSS provides us with several options for how to align text
using the text-align property and its attributes which are:
	
	1.Justify- this will cause all the lines of the text except for the last line to meet the left and right edges of the box line.
	2.Center- this centers the text
	3.Left- aligns text to the left
	4.Right-aligns text to the right

We can set an element's width by using the width property, and we can give the width value as a relative length unit using rem and em length units or give the width an absolute length by usin gthe px and percentage units of length

We can set the height an of element by using CSS's height property.
To make a certain text bold in HTML we wrap that text with the strong tag as is:

	<p> Hello <strong>World</strong>, I write Code</p> 

wrapping the text "World" with the strong tags will result in the text shown in bold.There CSS alternative to making a text bold is to use CSS property called font-weight with bold as its value as in:
	 "font-weight: bold;"
To underline text in HTML we show that specific text is important, this is not to be cofused for a link.
We use the "u" tag to achieve is ability , however in CSS we use the "text-decoration" property and give it a value of "underline" as in : 

	text-decoration: underline;

To emphasize a peice of text we use the em tag, this will show the text wrapped within the em tags in italics
In CSS to show a text in italics we use the "font-style" property with the value "italic" to achive this ability:
	
	font-style: italic;

To Show that piece of text is no longer valid we use the strikethrough tag to show this, in HTML we simply wrap the text around the <s> tag and in CSS we use the text-decoration property with the value "line-through"  as in:
	
	text-decoration: line-through;

You can use the <hr> tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content. hr is a self enclosing tag meaning it has no closing tag.

We can add a background color to a text to emphasize it instead of changing the actual color of the text, think of it as if you are highlighting the text , to achieve this ability we merely give the text a background-color property and use the "rgba" color system
the rgba color system is different from the normal rgb and hex code color system in that it has the aplha value which allows us to control the opacity of the color, the alpha value can take a value between 0 and 1 with 0 reprenting clearity or transparency and 1 representing a solid color.

HTML provides us with 6 header tags(h1 through h6) each differing in size with h1 being the biggest and h6 being the smallest. We can manipulate the sizes of each of these tags using the CSS property called "font-size" and with units of abosolute length(px or %) and relative length(rem and em).

ADDING BOX-SHADOW PROPERTY TO A CARD LIKE ELEMENT

The box-shadow property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The box-shadow property takes values for

offset-x (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),
offset-y (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),
blur-radius,
spread-radius and
color, in that order.
The blur-radius and spread-radius values are optional.

Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each box-shadow element.

Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly-transparent black colors:

	box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);

CSS provides us with the opacity property which we can  use to adjust the opacity or rather the transparency of the text,the opacity property takes a value between 0 and 1 , with 0 symbolizing complete transparency and 0.5 half transparency and 1 complete solid color meaning no transparent.

CSS provides us with a nifty property called text-transform which can be used to change the appearance of text without having to manually change the text yourself. Text-transfrom can be used to manipulate the appearance of the webpage text so that is appears consistently throughout the webpage. It has the following property values :
	
		Value	Result
	lowercase	"transform me"
	uppercase	"TRANSFORM ME"
	capitalize	"Transform Me"
	initial	Use the default value
	inherit	Use the text-transform value from the parent element


LINE-HEIGHT PROPERTY

CSS offers the line-height property to change the height of each line in a block of text. As the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets. syntax:
	
	p{
		font-size: 20px;
		line-height:25px;
	}

ADJUSTING THE HOVER STATE OF AN ANCHOR TAG

A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.
For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the ":hover pseudo-class selector". Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

	a:hover {
		color:red;
	}
