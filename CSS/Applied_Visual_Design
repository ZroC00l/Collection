INTRODUCTION TO APPLIED VISUAL DESIGN 
HTML is responsible for the structure and semantics of a page's content while CSS is in charge of the layout and appearance
This section covers the basic tools developers use to create their own visual design

Text is a huge part of a page's content, thus CSS provides us with several options for how to align text
using the text-align property and its attributes which are:
	
	1.Justify- this will cause all the lines of the text except for the last line to meet the left and right edges of the box line.
	2.Center- this centers the text
	3.Left- aligns text to the left
	4.Right-aligns text to the right

We can set an element's width by using the width property, and we can give the width value as a relative length unit using rem and em length units or give the width an absolute length by usin gthe px and percentage units of length

We can set the height an of element by using CSS's height property.
To make a certain text bold in HTML we wrap that text with the strong tag as is:

	<p> Hello <strong>World</strong>, I write Code</p> 

wrapping the text "World" with the strong tags will result in the text shown in bold.There CSS alternative to making a text bold is to use CSS property called font-weight with bold as its value as in:
	 "font-weight: bold;"
To underline text in HTML we show that specific text is important, this is not to be cofused for a link.
We use the "u" tag to achieve is ability , however in CSS we use the "text-decoration" property and give it a value of "underline" as in : 

	text-decoration: underline;

To emphasize a peice of text we use the em tag, this will show the text wrapped within the em tags in italics
In CSS to show a text in italics we use the "font-style" property with the value "italic" to achive this ability:
	
	font-style: italic;

To Show that piece of text is no longer valid we use the strikethrough tag to show this, in HTML we simply wrap the text around the <s> tag and in CSS we use the text-decoration property with the value "line-through"  as in:
	
	text-decoration: line-through;

You can use the <hr> tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content. hr is a self enclosing tag meaning it has no closing tag.
