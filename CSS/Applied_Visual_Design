INTRODUCTION TO APPLIED VISUAL DESIGN 
HTML is responsible for the structure and semantics of a page's content while CSS is in charge of the layout and appearance
This section covers the basic tools developers use to create their own visual design

Text is a huge part of a page's content, thus CSS provides us with several options for how to align text
using the text-align property and its attributes which are:
	
	1.Justify- this will cause all the lines of the text except for the last line to meet the left and right edges of the box line.
	2.Center- this centers the text
	3.Left- aligns text to the left
	4.Right-aligns text to the right
