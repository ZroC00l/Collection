INTRODUCTION TO CSS GRID
CSS grid helps you to easily build complex web designs. IT works by turning an HTML element into
a grid container with rows and columns , were you can place your child elements wherever you want
within the container.

CREATING YOUR FIRST CSS GRID
To create your first css grid your you need to add the "display: grid" CSS property.Which means the
HTML element you wish you convert into a grid container should have the CSS "display:grid" style of
format.

ADD COLUMNS WITH GRID-TEMPLATE-COLUMNS
Simply adding the "display:grid" CSS property to an HTML element wont change anything that much.Y
You need to define the structure of the grid as well. We do so by enlisting the help of another CSS
property called "grid-template-columns".

This property works by adding columns to the grid container. Each parameter value of the property
represents a column and the actual number is the width of that column.The following is syntax for
defining a grid container with 3 columns. Note each column has been set to 100px width, each of the
100px represents a column.
    <style>
        .container{
            display:grid;
            grid-template-columns:100px 100px 100px;
        }
