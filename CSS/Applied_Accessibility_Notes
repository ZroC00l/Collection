INTRODUCTION TO APPLIED ACCESSSIBILITY

In this section we will look at accessibility as a topic of interest. Accessibility has to do with having a web content and a user interface that is easily understood, can be navigated easily and used by a broad audience regardless of their ability or resources
We will focus of 3 general aspects of accessibility:
	1.Having a well structured  code , meaning using the proper markup.
	2.Having text alternatives for non-text and visual content.
	3.Easily navigated page that is keyboard friendly.

USING THE ALT ATTRIBUTE

Accroding to HTML5 standards its mandotory to include the alt attribute whenever using the img tag.
The alt attribute is used for accessiblity puropses such as assisting the visually impaired in interpreting the markup used in the web page. Visually impared people rely in the use of screen readers to be able to convert web content to an audio interface so they can be able to understand it.

There are cases ofcourse when you one needs to know where and when to apply the alt attribute. Alt attribute is neccessary to define but not necessary to associate a name to describe it in the following cases:
	
	1.When the img tag is used for decorative purposes there is no need to give your alt attirbute a name
	2.When the img tag used is already described in the text content.
	3.when images are captioned.

USING HEADING TAGS TO SHOW HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIPS OF CONTENT

HTML provides us with 6 heading tags(h1 to h6) when considering making your web content accessible to a broader range, you need to take special care of whenand where  to use each of the heading tags. It might be tempting to use a tag beacuse of its visual presentation on the browser but wehn using heading tags take special care of the semantic meaning.

Semantic meaning means that the tag you use around your content should indicate the information is includes. For instance according to HTML5 standards each web page should have a single h1 tag this tag is used as the main subject for your content.So an html page should have the proper hierarchy of heading tags a proper structure when writing up content using heading tags would look as follows, take note of the precendence order of the heading tags:

	<h1> Title</h1>
	<h2> Introduction</h2>
		<h3>subsection</h3>
			<h4>sub-subection</h4>

	<h2>Body</2>
		<h3>subsection</h3>
			<h4>sub-subsection</h4>
				<h5> another nested subsection</5>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

HTML5 NEW ELEMENTS 
HTML5 provides us with 6 new elements that can be used to structure content in a visually pleasing manner, these new elements are also equipped with accessibility features that caters for those with impairments.These new elements are:
	
	1.Header
	2.Main
	3.Article
	4.Section
	5.Nav
	6.Footer

The main tag is used to wrap your main content like the name implies.There can only be one main element per web page. It doesnt allow items that repeat to be wrapped inside it , these repeatable items include navaigation links and banners.

The Article tag is used as a sectioning element for independent and stand-alone content , unlike the Section tag which is used primarily for grouping thematically related content, the Article tag is a stand-alone tag.

The Header tag is used to wrap introductory information or navigation links. It works well with content that is repeated a the top across multiple pages.

USING THE AUDIO ELEMENT TO IMPROVE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THE AUDIO CONTENT

HTML5 provides us with the audio tag , this tag allows us to wrap audio stream or sound to our content.
Audio tag uses an attribute called "controls" this add the play,stop and other controls , this ofcourse depends on the browser used.
The audio tag supports two sound formats:
	1.ogg
	2.mpeg
The following is syntax on how to include an audio tag :
	
	<audio id="" controls>
		<source src="" type="audio/mpeg">
		<source src="" type="audio/ogg">
	<audio>

HTML5 provides us with yet another set of tags used for representing visual elements :
	1.Figure 
	2.Fifcaption

Used together these two elements can wrap a visual element together with its caption in a proper visual manner, these tags used on images, graphs, charts and diagrams.Note that the figcaption tag goes inside the figure tag and can also be comnined with other elements like the img tag.The following is an example of using the two tags:
	
	<figure>
		<img src="graph.jpeg" alt="bar graph">
		<br>
		<figcaption>
			This is my bar graph caption
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

In the earlier sections when we did HTML we covered forms and using various button, remember that to group buttons that belonged to the same group we required the use of the for and id attributes , the for attribute used within the label tags had to have the same name as the id attribute used inside the input element.This allowed the buttons to be grouped together , however there is a much better way to group button and in visually pleasing manned and thats to wrap the buttons inside the "fieldset" tag and give the fieldset and legend using the "legend" tag , this legend tag will give the grouped elements a description.

The following is an example to wrap radio buttons using fieldset and legend:

	<fieldset>
		<legend>List of Programming Lanaguages</legend>
			<input type="radio" id="java" name="java" value="languages">
			<label for="java">Java</label>
			<input type="radio" id="c++" name="c++" value="languages">
			<label for="c++">C++</label>
			<input type="radio" id="javascript" name="javascript> value="languages">
			<label for="javascript">Javascript</label>
	<fieldset>
